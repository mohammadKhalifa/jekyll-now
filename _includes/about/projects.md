## Projects


Here's a list of all **research projects** I was involved in:

* Energy-based models for Controllable Text Generation.
* Low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU.
* Abstractive Arabic summarization.
* FIRE 2019 shared Task for Irony Detection (1st place winner!)
* Book success prediction with readability scores and pre-trained sentence embeddings.
* Diacritic restoration by character LM pre-training.
* Dialect to MSA translation with unsupervised word mapping.
* Rumors detection by unsupervised time-series clustering.
* Agatha: Unsupervised time-series anomaly detection for predictive maintenance.
* Character-level models for sequence labeling
