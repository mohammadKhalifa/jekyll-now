My name is `M(u|o)hammad` Khalifa. I am a computer science master's student at *Cairo University*. My master's work is on Low-resource [multi-dialectal Arabic NLU](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2021.eacl-main.65/). My main research interests are **Generation**, **Representation Learning**, and **Few-Shot Learning**. I am currently an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Web Services, supervised by [Miguel Ballesteros](http://miguelballesteros.com/) and Prof. [Kathleen Mckeown](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/), working on multiple projects including Dialogue Summarization and Document Image Understanding. Previously, I was an intern at Naver Labs Europe where I worked on Controlled Text Generation and Energy-based models with [Hady Elsahar](https://www.hadyelsahar.io/) and [Marc Dymetman](https://scholar.google.com.eg/citations?user=D6J5pooAAAAJ&hl=en). Before that, I worked as a Machine learning research engineer at Sypron Solutions under the supervision of Dr. [Alaa Khamis](https://www.alaakhamis.org/), where I investigated **time-series anomaly detection** for preventive maintenance.
