## Muhammad Khalifa
I am a computer science master's student at *Cairo University*. My master's work is on Low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU and abstractive summarization. Thus, my main research interests are **Natural Language Generation**, **Unsupervised Learning**, and **Low-Resource NLU**. My interests are driven by the urgent need to save scarce-data languages and tasks by building fully unsupervised approaches that perform comparably to supervised ones. I am currently doing a research internship at Naver Labs Europe working on *Controlled text generation with Energy-based models* and supervised by Marc Deymetman and Hady Elsahar. Before that, I worked as a Machine learning research engineer at Sypron Solutions, where I investigated **time-series analyis and anomaly detection** for a predictive maintenance system, and designed a multi-node stream processing pipeline with *Spark Streaming*, *Kafka*, and *Cassandra DB*. I have worked on multiple projects spanning   [Character-Level models for Sequence Labeling](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333326547_Character_Convolutions_for_Arabic_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks/citations) , [Irony Detection](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2517/T4-7.pdf), and [Book Success Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11073). You can usually reach me at my personal email: muhammad.e.khalifa AT gmail.com. I built a few open-source projects and research paper implementations on my [Github](https://github.com/mohammadKhalifa).
