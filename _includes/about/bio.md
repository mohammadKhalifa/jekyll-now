## Muhammad Khalifa
I am a computer science master's student at *Cairo University*. My master's work is on Low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU and abstractive summarization. Thus, my main research interests are **Natural Language Generation**, **Unsupervised Learning**, and **Low-Resource NLU**. My interests are driven by the urgent need to save scarce-data languages and tasks by building fully unsupervised approaches that perform comparably to supervised ones. I am currenlty an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Web Services, working on multiple projects including dialogue summarization and Document Image Understanding. I previously did a research internship at Naver Labs Europe and worked on Controlled text generation and Energy-based models. Before that, I worked as a Machine learning research engineer at Sypron Solutions, where I investigated **time-series analyis and anomaly detection** for a predictive maintenance system, and designed a multi-node stream processing pipelineeeeee with *Spark Streaming*, *Kafka*, and *Cassandra DB*. 


**Updates:**

**March 1st, 2021:** My internship at AWS was extended. Now I am working on Document Image Understanding!

**Jan 12th, 2021:** TWO papers accepted at [ICLR](https://openreview.net/forum?id=jWkw45-9AbL) 2021 and [EACL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04758) 2021. 

**October 12th, 2020:** Started an applied scientist internship at Amazon Web Services, working with Miguel Ballesteros and Kathleen Mckeown on summarization.

**July 21th, 2020:** My paper on book success prediction (with Professor Aminul Islam) via pre-trained embeddings and readability scores is now live on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11073).

**May 5th, 2020:** Started an Internship in NAVER Labs Europe working on Controlled Text Generation with distributional constraints!
