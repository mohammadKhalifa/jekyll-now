<h2 id="muhammad-khalifa">Muhammad Khalifa</h2>
<p>I am a computer science master&#39;s student at Cairo University. My master&#39;s work is on Low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU and abstractive summarization. Thus, my main research interests are Natural Language Generation, Unsupervised Learning, and Low-Resource NLU. My interests are driven by the urgent need to save scarce-data languages and tasks by building fully unsupervised approaches that perform comparably to supervised ones. I am currenlty an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Web Services, working on multiple projects including dialogue summarization and Document Image Understanding. I previously did a research internship at Naver Labs Europe and worked on Controlled text generation and Energy-based models. Before that, I worked as a Machine learning research engineer at Sypron Solutions, where I investigated time-series analyis and anomaly detection for a predictive maintenance system, and designed a multi-node stream processing pipeline with Spark Streaming, Kafka, and Cassandra DB.</p>
