  <p>I will discuss the 2016 paper Language as a Latent Variable: Discrete Generative Models for Sentence Compression. The reason why I chose this paper is two-fold : First, it combines a lot of important ideas and concepts such as <strong>Variational Auto Encoders</strong>, <strong>Semi-Supervised learning</strong> and <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>. Second, itâ€™s relevant to my masterâ€™s thesis and I find that writing about a topic help make it clearer.</p>
