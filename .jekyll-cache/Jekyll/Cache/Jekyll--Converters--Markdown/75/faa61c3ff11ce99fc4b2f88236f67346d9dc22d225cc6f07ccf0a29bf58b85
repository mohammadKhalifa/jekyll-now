I"<p>I’m a second-year computer science master’s at Cairo University. I’m doing my thesis on Transfer Learning in low-resource NLP.
I’m fascinated by Natural Language Processing. 
In this tiny-part-of-the-world blog, I share some insights, discuss some recent ML/NLP papers and share my thoughts on current research trends.</p>
