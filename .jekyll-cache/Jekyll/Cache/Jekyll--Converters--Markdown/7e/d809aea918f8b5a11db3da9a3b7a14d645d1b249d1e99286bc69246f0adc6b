  <p>Haven’t posted in a while, but I decided to get back and get back strong! In this post, I will discuss the 2016 paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.07317">Language as a Latent Variable: Discrete Generative Models for Sentence Compression</a>. The reason why I chose this paper is two-fold : First, it combines a lot of important ideas and concepts such as <strong>Variational Auto Encoders</strong>, <strong>Semi-Supervised learning</strong> and <strong>Reinforcement Learning</strong>. Second, it’s relevant to my master’s thesis and I find that writing about a topic help make it clearer.</p>
