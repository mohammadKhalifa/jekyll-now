<p>I am Muhammad, a computer science masterâ€™s student at <em>Cairo University</em>. My masterâ€™s work is on low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU and abstractive summarization. Thus, my main research interests are Natural Language Generation, Unsupervised Learning, and Low-Resource NLU. I am also interested in Energy-based models for text generation and Structured Prediction. I believe thereâ€™s an urgent need to build fully unsupervised approaches that perform comparably to supervised ones, and that more attention needs to be given to low-resource settings</p>

<p>I have done research on <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333326547_Character_Convolutions_for_Arabic_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks/citations">character-level</a> models for Arabic NER comparing CNN to Bi-LSTMs.</p>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>

<p><strong>July 21th, 2020:</strong> My paper on book success prediction (with Professor Aminul Islam) via pre-trained embeddings and readability scores is now live on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11073">arxiv</a>.</p>

<p><strong>May 5th, 2020:</strong> Started an Internship in NAVER Labs Europe working on Controlled Text Generation with distributional constraints!</p>
