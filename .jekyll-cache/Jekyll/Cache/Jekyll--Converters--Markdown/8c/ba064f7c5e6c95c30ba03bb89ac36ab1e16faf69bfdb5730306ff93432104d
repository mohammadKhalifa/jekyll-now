<p>I am a computer science masterâ€™s student at <em>Cairo University</em>. My masterâ€™s work is on Low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU** and abstractive summarization. Thus, my main research interests are <strong>Natural Language Generation</strong>, <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>, and <strong>Low-Resource NLU</strong>. My interests are driven by the urgent need to save scarce-data languages and tasks by building fully unsupervised approaches that perform comparably to supervised ones. I am currently doing a research internship at Naver Labs Europe working on <em>Controlled text generation with Energy-based models</em> and supervised by Marc Deymetman and Hady Elsahar. Before that, I worked as a Machine learning research engineer at Sypron Solutions, where I investigated <strong>time-series analyis and anomaly detection</strong> for a predictive maintenance system, and designed a multi-node stream processing pipeline with <em>Spark Streaming</em>, <em>Kafka</em>, and <em>Cassandra DB</em>.</p>
