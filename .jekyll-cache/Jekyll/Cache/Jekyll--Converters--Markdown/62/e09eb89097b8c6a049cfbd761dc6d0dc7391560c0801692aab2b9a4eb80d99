  <p>ACL 2020 has been very special, since it is my first conference to attend. I have found the virtual version to be very nice (Altough my testimony is a bit undermined by the fact that I have not experienced an actual conference before. So, I cannot really compare the virtual version to the actual one). Anyway, I found the discussions, Q&amp;A, chat rooms, and the live talks were very engaging and interesting!</p>
