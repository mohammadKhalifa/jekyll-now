<p>I am a computer science master’s student at <em>Cairo University</em>. My master’s work is on Low-resource multi-dialectal Arabic NLU** and abstractive summarization. Thus, my main research interests are <strong>Natural Language Generation</strong>, <strong>Unsupervised Learning</strong>, and <strong>Low-Resource NLU</strong>. My interests are driven by the urgent need to save scarce-data languages and tasks by building fully unsupervised approaches that perform comparably to supervised ones. I am currently doing a research internship at Naver Labs Europe working on <em>Controlled text generation with Energy-based models</em> and supervised by Marc Deymetman and Hady Elsahar. Before that, I worked as a Machine learning engineer at Sypron Solutions, where I worked on <strong>time-series analyis and anomaly detection</strong> for a predictive maintenance system, and designed a multi-node stream processing pipeline with <em>Spark Streaming</em>, <em>Kafka</em>, and <em>Cassandra DB</em>. I have worked on multiple projects spanning   <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/333326547_Character_Convolutions_for_Arabic_Named_Entity_Recognition_with_Long_Short-Term_Memory_Networks/citations">character-level</a> models for sequence labeling, <a href="http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2517/T4-7.pdf">Irony Detection</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11073">book success prediction</a>. You can usually reach me at my personal email: muhammad.e.khalifa AT gmail.com.</p>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>

<p><strong>July 21th, 2020:</strong> My paper on book success prediction (with Professor Aminul Islam) via pre-trained embeddings and readability scores is now live on <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11073">arxiv</a>.</p>

<p><strong>May 5th, 2020:</strong> Started an Internship in NAVER Labs Europe working on Controlled Text Generation with distributional constraints!</p>
