> I and my co-authors recently wrote a blog post about our ICLR 2021 paper <a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=jWkw45-9AbL"> A Distributional Approach to Controlled Text Generation </a>. From this post, you should learn:
* What we mean by distributionally controlled text generation, and how previous approaches have completely ignored this aspect of control.
* How this task reduces to Exponential Family Energy-Based Models, and how we can leverage the EBM through a "distillation" process into an autoregressive policy for generation.
* An overview of our results and experiments in the paper.
* Finally, possibly yet unsolved problems with our technique.
